1) see code. uses a bubble sort to sort the array first then uses
 unordered_map on the array to link it up with a hash then looks
 up 100 and finds it in one. 
2) for Branden the hash is 4883539501400498415
3) tombstones are used to mark deleted cells in the hash table 
    The issue with introducing tombstones is it still has to skip
    over the tombstones so issues can occur over time where it 
    slows down search and insert operations.
