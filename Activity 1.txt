#1 To make an array you can just do arr[100];
#2 For each element the size is 4 bytes
#3  1) Reading
        it takes 1 step for reading 
    2) Searching for value not in array
        It can take up to 100 unless using a searching method
    3) Insert at begining
        100 + 1 steps since all need to be shifted back by one
        and there needs to be a step to add
    4) Insert at End
        1 step since add at the end
    5) Deletion at begining
        99 steps since remove first and shift all up one
    6) Deletion at end of array
        1 step since only delete last one
#4 N steps for N terms since we need to to check every item
