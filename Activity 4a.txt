1)  For average-case senerios with elements already sorted the element at index n-1 will have been compared
 n-1 times so the total number for comparisons is equivalent to N(N-1)/2 where N is the number of elements in the index. 
 So the O notation would transform into O(n^2) since we are removing any multiplier and refining the notation to its
  highest exponent.
2)  Start at index 0 instead of 1. 
    Worst case senerio the array is in descending order. [5,4,3,2,1]
    Step by step:
    i=0 sorted (on change)
    i=1 shift (1 change)
    i=2 shift (2 change)
    i=3 shift (3 change)
    i=4 shift (4 change)
    insert shifted (1+2+3+4=10)
    10+10=20
3)a) complexity = O(n) because linear since its only by string length
  b) reduce the code to immediatley return when x is found assuming it is sorted
  function containX(string){
    for (let i = 0; i< string.length; i++){
        if(string[i]=="X"){
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
  }
